# Optimizing an ML Pipeline in Azure

## Overview
This project is part of the Udacity Azure ML Nanodegree.
In this project, we build and optimize an Azure ML pipeline using the Python SDK and a provided Scikit-learn Logistic Regression model.
This model is then compared to an Azure AutoML run.

The diagram below shows the main steps of creating and optimizing an ML pipeline :

## Summary
The <a href="https://automlsamplenotebookdata.blob.core.windows.net/automl-sample-notebook-data/bankmarketing_train.csv">dataset</a> used in this project is related to direct marketing campaigns of a banking institution, which were based on on phone calls. The purpose here is to produce the best model to predict if the client will subscribe (yes/no) a term deposit (target variable "y"). This will go a long way to improve future marketing campaigns for the bank as it will predict the likelihood of a client to subscibe to a product that is being adverstised.

We create and optimize the hyperparameters of a standard Scikit-learn Logistic Regression using HyperDrive. We also use AutoML to build and optimize a model on the same dataset, so that we can compare the results of the two methods.

We performed 20 runs to find the best hyperparameters using HyperDrive; the highest reported accuracy was 90.72%. Similarly, we reached 55 iterations using the AutoML and he best performing model was Voting Ensemble, which achieved an accuracy of 91.77%.

## Scikit-learn Pipeline
**Explain the pipeline architecture, including data, hyperparameter tuning, and classification algorithm.**

**What are the benefits of the parameter sampler you chose?**

**What are the benefits of the early stopping policy you chose?**

## AutoML
**In 1-2 sentences, describe the model and hyperparameters generated by AutoML.**

## Pipeline comparison
**Compare the two models and their performance. What are the differences in accuracy? In architecture? If there was a difference, why do you think there was one?**

## Future work
**What are some areas of improvement for future experiments? Why might these improvements help the model?**
